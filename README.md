# Haproxy-and-Webservers


## Load balancing refers to efficiently distributing incoming network traffic across a group of backend servers, also known as a server farm or server pool.

## HAProxy (High Availability Proxy) is a TCP/HTTP load balancer and proxy server that allows a webserver to spread incoming requests across multiple endpoints. This is useful in cases where too many concurrent connections over-saturate the capability of a single server. In this repo we will be Using Ansible playbook and we will Configure Reverse Proxy i.e. Haproxy and update itâ€™s configuration file automatically on each time new Managed node (Configured With Apache Webserver) join the inventory.
